My name is Lena. I am a prospective teacher. 
Every day I have a lot of tasks to fulfill. 
I hardly have time for my family and friends because of it. 
That's why I wait for summer holidays each year. 
In summer I have more time for communication hobbies and fun.
What I like to do most of all in summer is doing sports. 
I like team sports. That's why I like to do sports with my friends. 
It brings me energy a good mood and a lot of fun.
